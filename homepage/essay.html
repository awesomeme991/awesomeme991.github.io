          <p> New York City is such a conflicting place. It’s dirty, ugly, and beautiful, impossibly all at once. You could walk down one block and see gorgeous works of architecture in which people reside filled with color and life, and down the next only to see rats carrying pizza slices down the sidewalk, and someone’s old refrigerator laying out in the middle of the road. The mix of chaos and peace creates a sort of balance that just works, and frankly it’s beautiful. Somehow preserved by man, areas of semi-natural and raw earth rest in the middle of all the lights and sirens. Surrounded by urbanization, these things we call parks give us a break from the busy setting, and let us focus on the simple things in life.
           One big pocket of nature that I hold dearly with me is Prospect Park.
           As far as parks go it has unlimited things to offer. It differs from calm, wavy, almost cartoony hills, to winding forests you could easily forget you're in the city when exploring.
           There's playgrounds, duck ponds, old architecture and bridges, and really huge statues of people, probably White racist guys praised for god knows what. Being that it was designed by the same person, Prospect Park shares similarities to Central Park . Don't get me wrong, Central Park is impressive in size, and definitely has much to offer, but it doesn't compare to the richness and personal value I can find in Prospect Park any day.
           Prospect Park has a special sense of locality to me which will never compare to that of any other park. Plus, one thing that all native New Yorkers have in common is our shared hatred for tourists, which are very much present in arguably fifty percent of central park.
            From barely being able to walk, to doubling my speed on a skateboard, Prospect Park has shared memories with me that no other park has. One I remember clearly is when I was in middle school. My parents had signed me up for the Prospect Park Zoo camp one year during the summer. I had been to loads of day camps that year, like Camp Half-Blood based on the Percy Jackson books, and Camp Bulldog for good old-fashioned sports. This camp I assumed would be a boring educational week about how animals communicate and hunt and all that jazz you would see on a nature documentary voiced by Morgan Freeman. To my pleasant surprise, though, we got to meet all sorts of different sized critters and even made the following day's meals for the sea lions in the zoo. These memories of summer camps help personalize the park for me, and create familiar space to do whatever my mind desires.
            To any Brooklyn raised boy, Prospect Park is like an extended backyard. To a street performer, Prospect Park is a place of unity for other musicians alike, forming drumming circles, and, if big enough, performing in the Lena Horne bandshell. For the average dad, Prospect Park is a perfect fishing spot or favorite barbeque area. No matter who you are, regardless of age, gender, interest or background, Prospect Park has something for you. Hell, there are even dog parks for all different breeds of your fluffy canine. Even today, when I step foot through that old brick perimeter, I can hear little league baseball players cheering at a teammate's homerun, see photographers capturing the art of skating, and smell cheap hot dogs being sold by middle aged men to bypassers looking for a quick bite.
            Although I don't go to Prospect Park as much anymore, I still try to take a walk there every once in a while. The park has become almost a sort of time capsule for me, in which I can revisit old memories. The best part is, although the city that never sleeps is constantly changing, I think this park is here to stay, hopefully even for the next generation--as long as global warming doesn't get to us first.
